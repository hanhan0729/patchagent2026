                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch.

Specifically, the line:\n\n```c\nlong top = 1L << td->td_bitspersample;\n```\n\nHere, `td->td_bitspersample` is of type `uint16` (unsigned short), which can potentially hold a value that, when used as a shift exponent, exceeds the limits for a 64-bit integer. This can lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to ensure that the shift operation does not exceed the maximum allowable shift for a `long` type. Since the maximum value for a 64-bit integer shift is 63 (as shifting by 64 or more can lead to undefined behavior), we should add a check to ensure `td->td_bitspersample` does not exceed this limit before performing the shift operation.\n\nHere's a proposed patch:\n\n```diff\n--- a/libtiff/tif_jpeg.c\n+++ b/libtiff/tif_jpeg.c\n@@ -1643,7 +1643,11 @@\n \t\t\t\tfloat refbw[6];\n-\t\t\t\tlong top = 1L << td->td_bitspersample;\n+\t\t\t\tlong top;\n+\t\t\t\tif (td->td_bitspersample > 63) {\n+\t\t\t\t    TIFFErrorExt(tif->tif_clientdata, module, \"Bits per sample %d is too high\", td->td_bitspersample);\n+\t\t\t\t    return 0;\n+\t\t\t\t}\n+\t\t\t\ttop = 1L << td->td_bitspersample;\n \t\t\t\trefbw[0] = 0;\n \t\t\t\trefbw[1] = (float)(top-1L);\n \t\t\t\trefbw[2] = (float)(top>>1);\n```\n\nThis patch adds a check to ensure that `td->td_bitspersample` does not exceed 63. If it does, an error is logged, and the function returns early to prevent the shift operation from executing. This should resolve the sanitizer issue without introducing new bugs.\n\nI will now validate this patch to ensure it resolves the issue correctly.\n\n"
